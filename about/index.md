# The Proposal

### From Meghan's point-of-view
On Tim's birthday we had plans to go to dinner at Martin's West in Redwood City.
It was a pleasant June evening, though a bit on the cool side.
We had a really nice dinner, though I remember Tim was acting a bit jittery throughout the meal, and I was slightly tired from work.

After we finished eating, Tim suggested we stroll around Redwood City since it was not quite sunset.
I agreed, though I was wearing a short sleeve dress and didn't bring a coat.
Tim offered be his sport jacket, but I declined since I was being stubborn.
We walked around the corner to The San Mateo County Hall of Justice, which was featured in "Harold and Maude" when Maude saves a tree.
Tim wanted to sit under the tree, but I didn't want to stay there because there was a high school couple making out.
We walked to a park near the library, but there were highschoolers hanging out there too.
I was getting grumpy because I was cold and wanted to go home.

We got home, greeted the dog, and were chatting in the kitchen.
All of a sudden, Tim kneeled down in front of me, and asked me if I would marry him.
I started crying and pulled him to his feet, hugging him.
He said, smiling, "You didn't answer yet."
I laughed and said, "Yes!".
The beautiful ring fit perfectly.

I had no idea he was planning to propose, especially on his birthday.
We opened some champagne and let the moment soak in.
Even though by that time it was late, I called my parents and sister, and texted friends to tell everyone the good news!

## The Wedding Party

### Bridesmaids

#### Kimberly Palagyi, The Maid of Honor
##### Sister
Kim is Meghan's sister whom she adores and loves dearly.
Though they are four years apart, they could pass as twins to people who haven't met them.
They are very close and share the same sense of humor, many of the same mannerisms, and even the same shoe size.
Meghan has always wanted to be blonde like Kim.

Kim will be a senior at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio this fall.
She is an Urban Studies major, and spent this past fall semester studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Kim is minoring in sculpture and materials explorations, and spends much of her time outside of class crafting beautifully sculpted pieces out of wood.

#### Julia Winder
##### Best friend from high school
Julia and Meghan met at Princeton High School through mutual friends.
They were on the swim team sophomore winter together, suffering through two-a-days and dry land workouts.
Much to the chagrin of their teachers, the two had the majority of their classes together senior year, causing all sorts of mayhem and antics, in addition to being super peer group leaders!

Last fall, Meghan was thrilled that Julia moved to San Francisco, enabling them to spend a lot more time together and have a blast in the Bay Area.
Meghan admires Julia's effervescent energy, perpetual warmth towards family, and acquaintaces alike, and feels so very lucky to have her as a friend.

#### Sarah Solomon
##### Best friend from college
Sarah and Meghan became fast friends their freshman year at Drexel, initially due in part to their preppy sensibilities.
Coincidentally, both were graphic design majors assigned to the top floor of the freshman honors Race Street dormitory.
Through college they maintained their "honors advantage" together, figuring out which classes to take and how to get ahead in the major.
Their strategy included taking a notably terrible Writing Center tutoring workshop once a week to fulfill a writing requirement.

Sarah lives and works in New York City.
She is a talented writer, and maintains her sharp wit by continuing to write incredibly apt humour pieces.
She has been a supporter and friend to Meghan and Tim, both as individuals and as a couple from the beginning of their relationship.
Meghan is thrilled that Sarah will be standing with her on their wedding day.

### Groomsmen

#### Zach Faden, Best Man
##### Best friend growing up
Growing up just a couple blocks apart, Zach and Tim have been friends since 1st grade.
Even in the years they were in different classes, or later, in different schools, Zach and Tim were always close.
Through the many sleepovers, games of ping-pong and chess, street hockey, and sharing of a good book, Zach has been a big part of Tim's life, and continues to be a reliable friend.

After finishing a dual degree at American University in Washington D.C., Zach completed his Masters at The University of Edinburgh in Scotland, and now lives in Washington D.C., consulting for the Department of Defense.


#### Dustin Ingram
##### Best friend in college
Dustin and Tim met during freshmen year at Drexel, thanks to some mutual friends.
Although they were both computer science majors, they never seemed to have any classes together, and took very different directions within the computer science field.
Starting in sophomore year, Dustin and Tim were roommates in the same house for three years.
Bikes, beer, spray paint, parties, and late nights coding were shared.

After completeing his Masters, and working for the Naval Research Laboratory, Dustin recently complete a cross-country bike trip, travelling from Philadelphia through St. Augustine, FL and ending in San Diego, CA.
