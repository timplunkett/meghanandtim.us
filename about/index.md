# The Proposal

### From Meghan's point-of-view
On Tim's birthday we had plans to go to dinner at Martin's West in Redwood City.
It was a pleasant June evening, though a bit on the cool side.
We had a really nice dinner, though I remember Tim was acting a bit jittery throughout the meal, and I was slightly tired from work.

After we finished eating, Tim suggested we stroll around Redwood City since it was not quite sunset.
I agreed, though I was wearing a short sleeve dress and didn't bring a coat.
Tim offered me his sport jacket, but I declined since I was being stubborn.
We walked around the corner to The San Mateo County Hall of Justice, which was featured in "Harold and Maude" when Maude saves a tree.
Tim wanted to sit under the tree, but I didn't want to stay there because there was a high school couple making out there.
We walked to a park near the library, but there were high-schoolers hanging out there too.
I was getting grumpy because I was cold and wanted to go home.

We got home, greeted the dog, and were chatting in the kitchen.
All of a sudden, Tim kneeled down in front of me, and asked me if I would marry him.
I started crying and pulled him to his feet, hugging him.
He said, smiling, "You didn't answer yet."
I laughed and said, "Yes!".
The beautiful ring fit perfectly.

I had no idea he was planning to propose, especially on his birthday.
We opened some champagne and let the moment soak in.
Even though by that time it was late, I called my parents and sister, and texted friends to tell everyone the good news!
