## The Wedding Party

### The Maid of Honor: Kim Palagyi
Kim is Meghan's younger sister.
Though four years apart, they are very close.
Kim is a senior Urban Studies major at the College of Wooster in Wooster Ohio.
She is also pursuing sculture and materials explorations, spending much of her time in the Industrial and woodworking labs.

### Bridesmaid: Julia Winder
Julia and Meg met sophomore year at Princeton High School.
They were on the swim team that winter together.
Mrs. Murphey's english class senior year, peer group.
Much to the chagrin of their teachers, the two had the majority of their classes together senior year and were quite disruptive.
They didn't see each other very much while in college, though Julia did visit "Drex-mex" and Meghan visited Bates Julia's senior year.
Last year Meghan was thrilled that Julia was moving to SF and they have been able to spend a lot more time together.

### Bridesmaid: Sarah Solomon
Sarah and Meghan became friends their freshman year at Drexel.
Coincidentally both were graphic design majors living on the 11th floor of the freshman honors Race Street dorm.
They maintained their "honors advantage" together, figuring out which classes to take and how to get ahead.
This strategy included taking a notably terrible Writing Center tutoring workshop.

### Best Man: Zach Faden
Zach and Tim have been friends since 1st grade.
@todo.

### Groomsman: Dustin Ingram
Dustin and Tim were college roommates for three years.
@todo.
