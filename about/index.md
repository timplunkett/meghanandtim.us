# About us
### 2008
In October 2008 at a General Body Meeting for WKDU, Drexel's student-run radio station, Tim purposefuly sat down in the chair next to Meghan, Meghan introduced herself, and that was the beginning of many missed connections, miscommunications, and an otherwise on-and-off pursuit.
On the election night of President Obama, Meghan was walking back to her dorm after finishing her radio show, as Tim was headed back to his house in West Philly, after biking down to City Hall to celebrate the win.
As they walked through campus together, Meghan realized that she had feelings for Tim.
Shortly after they kissed for the first time, started dating, and quickly became inseparable.

### 2009
In spring 2009 we were both elected to the executive staff at the radio station, Meghan as Public Relations Director and Tim as General Manager.
That summer, we cleaned out the old exec office, and worked on the new WKDU website together, which was the first Drupal site we launched as a pair.

### 2010
The next spring Tim left Drexel, as Meghan was elected to be the General Manager.
During the summer of 2010 Meghan did her co-op and Tim did freelance work for the same company, Canary PR + Design.
In the fall of 2010, Tim started working at Zivtech.

### 2011
Meghan was hired in March 2011 after she graduated from Drexel, as a designer.
Shortly after we decided to move in together in Old City.
At the end of the summer when Tim got back from Drupalcon London, we adopted Walker Texas Ranger, renamed Dodger, our rescue pit bull/Boston terrier mix.
We loved living and working in Philly together, but we were also looking for the next thing.

### 2012
Tim became more active prominent in the Drupal community, and logged a lot of miles traveling to conferences.
In the fall we traveled to Munich, via Copenhagen and had an amazing time.

### 2013
In January 2013, we both interviewed for positions on the web team of the IT department at Stanford's Graduate School of Business.
They made us an offer, and we decided to move to the Bay Area to fill the positions.
In March 2013 we packed up everything and moved to Redwood City, CA.

## The Wedding Party

### The Maid of Honor: Kim Palagyi

### Bridesmaid: Julia Winder
Julia and Meg met sophomore year at Princeton High School.
They were on the swim team that winter together.
Mrs. Murphey's english class senior year, peer group.
Much to the chagrin of their teachers, the two had the majority of their classes together senior year and were quite disruptive.
They didn't see each other very much while in college, though Julia did visit "Drex-mex" and Meghan visited Bates Julia's senior year.
Last year Meghan was thrilled that Julia was moving to SF and they have been able to spend a lot more time together.

### Bridesmaid: Sarah Solomon
Sarah and Meghan became friends their freshman year at Drexel.
Coincidentally both were graphic design majors living on the 11th floor of the freshman honors Race Street dorm.
They maintained their "honors advantage" together, figuring out which classes to take and how to get ahead.
This strategy included taking a notably terrible Writing Center tutoring workshop.

### Best Man: Zach Faden
Zach and Tim have been friends since 1st grade.

### Groomsman: Dustin Ingram
Dustin and Tim were college roommates for three years.
