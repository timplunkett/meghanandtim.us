# About us

### He proposed, She said yes!
Meghan made dinner reservations for Tim's birthday, and they had a really nice time at a restaurant in Redwood City. 

After they got home, they were chatting in the kitchen.
Suddenly, Tim kneeled down in front of Meghan with a ring in a box, and asked if she would marry him.
Meghan started crying and pulled him to his feet, hugging him.
He said, smiling, "You didn't answer yet."
She laughed and said, "Yes!".
The beautiful ring fit perfectly on her finger.

Meghan had no idea he was planning to propose, especially on his birthday.
They opened some champagne and let the moment soak in.
Even though by that time it was late, they called their parents, and texted friends to tell everyone the good news!
