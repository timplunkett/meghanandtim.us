# The Proposal

### From Meghan's point-of-view
On Tim's birthday we had plans to go to dinner at Martin's West in Redwood City. It was a pleasant June evening, though a bit on the cool side. We had a really nice dinner, though I remember Tim was acting a bit jittery throughout the meal, and I was slightly tired from work.

After we finished eating, Tim suggested we stroll around Redwood City since it was not quite sunset. I agreed, though I was wearing a short sleeve dress and didn't bring a coat. Tim offered be his sport jacket, but I declined since I was being stubborn. We walked around the corner to The San Mateo County Hall of Justice, which was featured in "Harold and Maude" when Maude saves a tree. Tim wanted to sit under the tree, but I didn't want to stay there because there was a high school couple making out. We walked to a park near the library, but there were highschoolers hanging out there too. I was getting grumpy because I was cold and wanted to go home.

We got home, greeted the dog, and were chatting in the kitchen. All of a sudden, Tim kneeled down in front of me, and asked me if I would marry him. I started crying and pulled him to his feet, hugging him. He said, smiling, "You didn't answer yet." I laughed and said, "Yes!". The beautiful ring fit perfectly.  I had no idea he was planning to propose, especially on his birthday. We opened some champagne and let the moment soak in. Even though by that time it was late, I called my parents and sister to tell them, and texted my friends to tell everyone the good news!

### Bridesmaids

#### Kimberly Palagyi, The Maid of Honor
Kim is Meghan's sister whom she adores and loves dearly.
Though they are four years apart, they could pass as twins to people who haven't met them.
They are very close and share the same sense of humor, many of the same mannerisms, and even their shoe size.
Meghan has always wanted to be blonde like Kim.

Kim will be a senior at the College of Wooster in Wooster, Ohio this fall.
She is an Urban Studies major, and spent this past fall semester studying abroad in Copenhagen, Denmark.
Kim is minoring in sculpture and materials explorations, and spends much of her time outside of class crafting beautifully sculpted pieces out of wood.

#### Julia Winder, Bridesmaid
Julia and Meg met sophomore year at Princeton High School.
They were on the swim team that winter together.
Mrs. Murphey's english class senior year, peer group.
Much to the chagrin of their teachers, the two had the majority of their classes together senior year and were quite disruptive.
They didn't see each other very much while in college, though Julia did visit "Drex-mex" and Meghan visited Bates Julia's senior year.
Last year Meghan was thrilled that Julia was moving to SF and they have been able to spend a lot more time together.

#### Sarah Solomon, Bridesmaid
Sarah and Meghan became friends their freshman year at Drexel.
Coincidentally both were graphic design majors living on the 11th floor of the freshman honors Race Street dorm.
They maintained their "honors advantage" together, figuring out which classes to take and how to get ahead.
This strategy included taking a notably terrible Writing Center tutoring workshop.
