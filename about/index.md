# About us


## The Proposal

From Meghan's point-of-view:
On Tim's birthday we had plans to go to dinner at Martin's West in Redwood City. It was nice June evening, though a bit on the cool side. We had a really nice dinner, though I remeber Tim was acting a bit jittery throughout the meal, and I was slightly tired from work.  After we finished eating, Tim suggested we stroll around Redwood City since it was not quite sunset. I agreed, though I was wearing a short slleeve dress and didn't bring a coat. Tim offered be his sport jacket, but I declined since I was being stubborn. We walked around the corner to The San Mateo County Hall of Justice, which was featured in "Harold and Maude" when Maude saves a tree. Tim wante to sit under it, but I didn't want to stay there because there was a highschool couple making out. We walked to a park near the library, but there were higschoolers hanging out there too. I was getting grumpy because I was cold and wanted to get home, so Tim agreed that we go home.  When we got home, we greeted the dog, and were chatting in the kitchen. All of a sudden, Tim kneeled down in front of me, and asked me if I would marry him. I started crying and pulled him to his feet, and hugged him, when he said, smiling, "You didn't answer yet." I laughed and said, "Yes!". The ring is beautiful and it fit perfectly.  I had no idea he was planning to propose, especially on his birthday. Even though by that time  it was late, I called my parents and sister to tell them, and texted my friends to tell everyone the good news.

Last year Meghan was thrilled that Julia was moving to SF and they have been able to spend a lot more time together.
