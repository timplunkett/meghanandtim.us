### We're getting married!

Over the past five and a half years we have made many big decisions together, but deciding to get married is the most significant milestone yet.
While we have counted on and trusted each other throughout our relationship, the love, support, and encouragement of friends and family has meant so much to us as individuals and as a couple.
We are thrilled to be exchanging our vows in October, and we hope you will be there to share the day with us.

<strong>We canâ€™t wait to celebrate with you!</strong>
