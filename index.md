# We're getting married!

We are thrilled to be exchanging vows in front of our friends and family in October. Over the past five, almost six years, we've made a lot of big decisions together, and while we have relied on and trusted each other, we couldn't have done anything without the love, support, and encouragement from you.

### We canâ€™t wait to celebrate with you!
