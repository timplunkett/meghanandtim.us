# We're getting married!

Over the past five and a half years we have made many significant decisions together, but marriage is the first major milestone of our relationship. We are thrilled to be exchanging vows in front of our friends and family in October, and we hope you will be there to share it with us. While we have relied on and trusted each other throughout the wedding planning and preparation, we couldn't have done it without your love, support, and encouragement. We canâ€™t wait to celebrate with you!
