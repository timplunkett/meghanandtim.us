# Ceremony &amp; Reception

We are really exicited to have our ceremony and reception at the Washington Crossing Inn. The Inn is a traditional colonial-style structure, featuring a faithfully preserved 1817 home. There is a parking lot right next the the Inn, and there will most likely be valet parking that evening.

## Gazebo Ceremony - 5:30pm
Our ceremony will be held outdoors in the Washington Crossing Inn garden beginning at 5:30pm.
In the event of inclement weather, the ceremony will be moved under a tent on the grounds. The ceremony will be presided over by our officiant, Renee Mundy.

## Cocktail Hour - 6:00pm
Please join us for a cocktail hour on the patio next to the garden, immediately following the ceremony. There will be passed Hors d'oeuvres and a jazz trio.

## Reception - 7:00pm
A seated dinner and dancing will be held in the ballroom beginning at 7:00pm.
