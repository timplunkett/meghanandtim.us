We are excited to hold our ceremony and reception at the Washington Crossing Inn.
Our venue search started with manors and estates in the Philadelphia area.
Unfortunately none of the places we ended up visiting really had what we were looking for.
Then Meghan's parents suggested the Washington Crossing Inn, since it was central to both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and not far from Philadelphia.
The Inn is a charming traditional colonial-style building just a short walk from the Delaware River, providing a perfect setting for our festivities and photographs.

### Gazebo Ceremony - 5:30pm
Our ceremony will be held outdoors in the Washington Crossing Inn garden beginning at 5:30pm.

The ceremony will be presided over by our officiant, Renee Mundy.

Please join us for a cocktail hour on the patio in the garden, immediately following the ceremony.
There will be passed hors d'oeuvres and a jazz trio.
