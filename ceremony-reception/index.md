We are excited to hold our ceremony and reception at the Washington Crossing Inn.
Our venue search started with manors and estates in the Philadelphia area.
Unfortunately none of the places we ended up visiting really had what we were looking for.
Then Meghan's parents suggested the Washington Crossing Inn, since it was central to both New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and not far from Philadelphia.
The Inn is a charming traditional colonial-style building just a short walk from the Delaware River, providing a perfect setting for our festivities and photographs.
